# Time Series Analysis and Air Quality Index (AQI) Project

Welcome to the **Time Series Analysis**! This repository showcases a combination of **time series analysis quiz files** and an insightful project analyzing the **Air Quality Index (AQI)**. 

## Repository Contents

### 1. **Time Series Analysis - Quiz Files**
   - These files document solutions and explorations from quizzes related to **Time Series Analysis**. 
   - The topics include:
     - Statistical methods for forecasting.
     - Analysis of trends, seasonality, and noise.
     - Application of ARIMA, SARIMA, and other advanced models.
   - These quizzes are designed to deepen understanding of time series methodologies and enhance analytical skills.

### 2. **Air Quality Index (AQI) Project**
   - **Overview**: This project performs an in-depth analysis of **Air Quality Index (AQI)** data, including:
     - Data preprocessing and cleaning.
     - Identification of trends, seasonality, and outlier detection.
     - Predictive modeling to forecast AQI values.
   - **Objectives**:
     - To study the long-term and short-term trends in AQI levels.
     - To understand the environmental factors influencing AQI fluctuations.
     - To provide actionable insights for better air quality management.
   - **Key Techniques**:
     - Time series decomposition.
     - Regression modeling.
     - Forecasting using advanced models such as **Exponential Smoothing** and **ARIMA**.
